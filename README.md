Transfers all unread links from [ReadItLater](http://readitlaterlist.com) to [Instapaper](http://instapaper.com)

Just run `ril_to_instapaper.rb` from the commandline and you will be prompted for your username and password for both services. Your credentials won't be stored anywhere, and must be entered each time you run the script.

All 'unread' links will then be transferred from your ReadItLater account to your Instapaper account, and a result summary is printed.

Glad to help, nfp, etc.
