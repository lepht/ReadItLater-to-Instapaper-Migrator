A commandline tool to transfer unread links from [Pocket](http://getpocket.com) (formerly ReadItLater) to [Instapaper](http://instapaper.com).

## Usage
Run `ril_to_instapaper.rb` and enter the username and password for both services when prompted. Credentials aren't stored and must be re-entered each time you execute the script.

All 'unread' links are transferred from the given Pocket account to the Instapaper account's reading list and a result summary is printed.

Glad to help, nfp, etc.
